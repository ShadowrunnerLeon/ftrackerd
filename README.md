# ftrackerd

## Descripton
ftrackerd is a daemon that monitors file size changes using fstat () and sends reports to the client over UDP.

## Descripton of libraries
- createdaemon.h - implementation of the daemon creation function.
- logLib.h - functions for working with logs and configs.
- HashTable.h - functions for working with a hash table.

## How to use
Before using it, you need to setup create_test_files.py

Example of running the program:

    sudo ./ftrackerd 80 5

The first parameter is responsible for the port, the second - for the waiting time of the daemon.
The daemon can be started without parameters, then the default port value is 16680, and the waiting time is 1 second.

To make sure that the daemon is running, enter the following command in the terminal:

    ps -ef | grep ./ftrackerd

Then you can run udp_client on another device. The main condition is that the devices must be connected to a local network. Example of running udp_client:

    ./udp_client track /tmp/file

When running udp_client, the command to address the daemon is specified. There are four of them in total:

    hello       - display greeting
    track       - display file status(changed or not changed)
    track file1 - display file status(changed or not changed) of file1
    help        - display this commands

If you updated the config while the daemon was running, you need to send it a SIGHUP signal using this command in the terminal:

    sudo killall -HUP ./ftrackerd
    
To disable the daemon, enter:

    sudo killall ./ftrackerd

To delete test files, setup delete_test_files.py

## P.S
You can fill in the config with your values. The first line is responsible for the number of tracked files, and the following lines are the paths to those files.
